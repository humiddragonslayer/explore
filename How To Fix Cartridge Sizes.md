Step 1: 

There's a thing where some companies have a superior design, but it's a proprietary design. And people often say it's justified to keep it proprietary, and the design is very good so what would you have them do? Give it away?
I have a solution, but it will likely never actually get implemented
They should spin off the people who designed that (in this case the cartridge for the pen), and that should be a separate company that owns the design, and can license it out to each company
Now, since the design was still funded by the company who used it as a proprietary design, they can have an amount that the new company owes them for that investment
And until that investment's amount has been met, the monthly/yearly license fee will keep getting deducted from that debt
So the original company benefits (for a while), and all of the other companies can also benefit
