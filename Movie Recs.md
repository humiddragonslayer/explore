- ## Inaccessible to dumbasses (in order of quality, higher is better)
	- Charlie Kaufman's movies (will break you down to some extent, but in service of very real truths about existence, worth it)
		- Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind (the cold/mess of movies)
		- Anomalisa
		- Adaptation
		- I'm Thinking of Ending Things (works best on the second watch, or with a handy breakdown afterwards)
		- Synecdoche, New York (proceed with caution/readiness to not understand much without help)
	- Wes Anderson's movies (I'm only listing the top among the ones I've seen, but I genuinely think you can't really go wrong with any of them, though the last two are more steeped in his style and might serve you better later on in the order)
		- The Grand Budapest Hotel
		- Moonrise Kingdom
		- Bottle Rocket
		- The French Dispatch
		- Asteroid City
	- Nanpakal Nerathu Mayakkam (is in my top 10 of all time, possibly top 5)
	- the Before Trilogy (the Mamma Mia of movies)
		- Before Sunrise
		- Before Sunset
		- Before Midnight
	- Oldboy (Revenge is the secret of my energy)
	- Paprika (what if Inception was anime? but also not really)
