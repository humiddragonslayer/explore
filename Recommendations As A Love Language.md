Tastes, which used to be of a few types (genres, mainstream/alt) have given way to uniquely curated consumption. Your tastes are now a fingerprint. And due to similar backgrounds/exposures, those close to you would have a similar taste/consumption method. Recommendations are our way of keeping those close to us in spacetime also close to us in consumption.

My brothers and I are at our closest when we discover new music, which used to be together. 

Love is letting yourself be changed.

You can know the company I keep by my recommendations to them.

Accepting recommendations is a reciprocal way of showing you care about someone

When you recommend something, you are also showing love to the art

It's when you give of yourself that you truly give - Khalil Gibran
