I sat there, at the edge of the ground, the open space letting the last of the silence echo against it. The drums had started. They bellowed, rolled and even threatened. I stood there, transfixed. Was it real or was it artificial? Fake, I said, daring Mother Nature to prove me wrong. 

It started with a few warning shots, scattered, rarefied. Grazing me, but not doing the damage I wished it did. The drums got louder. Actually, that's not right. They were always loud enough to beat in my rib cage. It's just that they weren't so close to me 30 seconds ago.

I turned around and started walking away, though the drums convinced my head to turn back every few steps. Mocking me for running from rain. I slunk back to safety, and paced as the two wolves fought. Who won? I don't think I should ask that question.

I ran back into the percussion, the street and the sky colliding thousands of times a second. When does the rain become water? Once the drop drops, it's done. Sometimes I feel like a drop, useless as soon as my verb has been conjugated. What is mine, though? When will Dan have Danned? Will I die too early to see that? Or too late to remember it?

I got back to where I first heard the drums. That's not true, I chickened out and just stood where I could see it. But that was enough. It was an honour to be in the front row. Thanks. I needed that.
