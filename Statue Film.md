A movie where the entire 'acting' is done by statues/paintings with voiceovers. Dialogue over visuals much?

Statues of freedom fighters, with the story set before Independence. It can be a depressing story, but wide shots will literally show you that Independent India can exist. Maybe a few shots in Pakistan if we can manage it.
