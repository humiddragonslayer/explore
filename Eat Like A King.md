Think of all the meals you've had. Now think of all the meals that you've forgotten, lost in the drone of daily routine. What about your most memorable? Not a top ten, just look at the peaks when you see all your meal-related memories at once. What picture does that landscape paint? 

I have a feeling that the highest peaks and lowest valleys would both be ruled by breakfasts. Lunch and dinner might be a higher altitude on average, but never far above sea level. 

The modern urban being operates off of two time stamps: the beginning and ending of economic activity (work and education, in my manhandling of the phrase). The beginning of economic activity is often linked to a deep melancholy, and Garfield would be the first to agree. Thus, in our preparation for the plunge back into the system, we steel ourselves, not leaving time or energy for social connection. The food is just fuel, so you don't have to face the world on an empty stomach. 

The opposite, of course, is true for the endings. Even atheists TGIF. Once we're done proving our worth to society, we finally let loose. Dinner (and lunch to a lesser extent) is the meal for friends, lovers and family. A time to allot as we see fit. But it is still an allowance, a deep breath in a greater suffocation. It betrays itself upon deeper examination, like the window of a prison cell.

So when there's a break that breaks from the routine of the breaks, we feel like we caught quite the big break indeed. Our first meal of the day is the one most ruled by the routine. Naturally, the breakfasts to break that pattern are the ones that make us feel like rulers instead. Only during breakfasts can you truly eat like a king.

There is a meal we haven't talked about. One that isn't bittersweet like breakfast, because it simply cannot be eaten as part of a normal workweek.

Brunch.

How can you squander the daylight hours unproductively without being rich in them? A king might have breakfasts, but only an emperor can afford brunches. Time isn't money, it's real estate, and brunchtime is the most gentrified neighbourhood of them all. Brunches would make sense as a currency, because it's concentrated in the hands of the few. 

Breakfast corrupts, but brunch corrupts absolutely.

A single life filled with daily brunches can only be sustained by several others with none at all.

The next time you're staring down the barrel of a Monday, see if you can spice up more than just the food. Write a haiku, make a noise you've never made before, or just make plans for weekend brunch. Your soul will thank you.
