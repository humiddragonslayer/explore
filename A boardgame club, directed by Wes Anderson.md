Shots:
- Walking across frame holding a boardgame
- Two opponents opposite each other, shown successively. The first one is fidgeting, slightly impatient, and the second one is deep in thought.
- Cut to a top down shot of both staring at the board. 
- Cut to a sideways shot of the both of them. The right one makes a move, then both look up at each other, and blink.
- The left one tosses the board, sending meeple everywhere.
- Walking back across frame holding a boardgame
